Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

When a foreground service is stopped, its associated notification is also removed by default if `true` is passed to `stopForeground(true)`. If `stopForeground(false)` is called, the notification remains visible after the service is stopped, but it will be removed if the service is later stopped completely or if the app is terminated. The `stopForeground(int flags)` method can also be used, with flags like `Service.STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` (to remove the notification) or `Service.STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` (to detach the notification so it can be managed independently, though this is less common).",

It operates on the UI thread for read/write operations (can cause ANRs), lacks type safety, and doesn't provide a way to signal completion or errors for asynchronous operations. `DataStore` is a newer, more robust data storage solution from Jetpack. It comes in two implementations: `Preferences DataStore` (stores key-value pairs with improvements over SharedPreferences) and `Proto DataStore` (stores typed objects backed by protocol buffers). `DataStore` is preferred because it's asynchronous (using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow), provides type safety (especially Proto DataStore), handles data migration from SharedPreferences, and offers error signaling.",

            answerText = "Jetpack Compose is a declarative UI toolkit. `@Composable` functions are special Kotlin functions that describe how your UI should look for a given state. They can call other `@Composable` functions to build a UI hierarchy. UI state is any data that can change over time and affect the UI; in Compose, state is typically held in `MutableState` objects (e.g., `mutableStateOf()`). When the state a `@Composable` function reads changes, Compose automatically re-invokes (recomposes) that function and any other composables that also read that state, updating only the necessary parts of the UI. `remember` is used to preserve state across recompositions (e.g., user input in a TextField, or a counter). It stores an object in memory during the initial composition and returns the stored value during recompositions. If `remember` is not used, the state would be reset every time the composable is recomposed.",

This significantly reduces the size of your APK or AAB.\n*   **Optimization:** It analyzes and optimizes the bytecode, making the app run more efficiently. This can involve inlining methods, removing dead code, and other bytecode-level improvements.\n*   **Obfuscation:** It renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short, meaningless names (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`). This makes it much harder for others to reverse-engineer your app.\nIt is important for release builds because it helps to reduce the app size, improve runtime performance, and protect your intellectual property by making the code difficult to understand if decompiled.",

            answerText = "1. **Load Scaled Bitmaps:** Read the bitmap dimensions first by setting `BitmapFactory.Options.inJustDecodeBounds = true`. Then, calculate an appropriate `BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize` to load a scaled-down version of the image into memory that matches the display dimensions, significantly reducing memory usage. After calculating `inSampleSize`, set `inJustDecodeBounds = false` and decode the bitmap. 2. **Use Image Loading Libraries:** Libraries like Glide, Coil, or Picasso are highly recommended. They automatically handle bitmap caching (memory and disk), downsampling, transformations, and efficient loading, abstracting away many complexities and reducing the risk of `OutOfMemoryError`. 3. **Recycle Bitmaps (Carefully):** For manually managed `Bitmap` objects, especially in older code or specific low-level scenarios, call `bitmap.recycle()` when it's no longer needed to free up native memory. However, this is error-prone and less necessary with modern Android versions and image loading libraries, which often manage this. 4. **Use Appropriate Bitmap Configuration:** Choose a `Bitmap.Config` that suits your needs. For example, `Bitmap.Config.RGB_565` uses 2 bytes per pixel instead of 4 bytes for `Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888`, which can halve memory usage if alpha transparency is not required. 5. **Handle Large Images in Background Threads:** Perform bitmap decoding and processing off the main UI thread (e.g., using coroutines or other threading mechanisms) to prevent ANRs.",
