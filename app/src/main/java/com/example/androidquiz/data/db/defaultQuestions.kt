Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This is important for loosely coupled systems because it decouples high-level policy from low-level implementation details, making the system more flexible, testable, and maintainable.

To start a foreground service, you must call `startForegroundService()` instead of `startService()`. Within five seconds of calling `startForegroundService()`, the service must call its `startForeground()` method, providing a non-null Notification to be displayed to the user and a unique integer ID for the notification.

When a foreground service is stopped, its associated notification is also removed by default if `true` is passed to `stopForeground(true)`. If `stopForeground(false)` is called, the notification remains visible after the service is stopped, but it will be removed if the service is later stopped completely or if the app is terminated. The `stopForeground(int flags)` method can also be used, with flags like `Service.STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` (to remove the notification) or `Service.STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` (to detach the notification so it can be managed independently, though this is less common).",

They can call other `@Composable` functions to build a UI hierarchy. UI state is any data that can change over time and affect the UI; in Compose, state is typically held in `MutableState` objects (e.g., `mutableStateOf()`). When the state a `@Composable` function reads changes, Compose automatically re-invokes (recomposes) that function and any other composables that also read that state, updating only the necessary parts of the UI. `remember` is used to preserve state across recompositions (e.g., user input in a TextField, or a counter). It stores an object in memory during the initial composition and returns the stored value during recompositions.

In Android development, it's primarily used for:\n*   **Shrinking (Tree Shaking):** It removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes from your packaged app, including those from included code libraries. This significantly reduces the size of your APK or AAB.\n*   **Optimization:** It analyzes and optimizes the bytecode, making the app run more efficiently. This can involve inlining methods, removing dead code, and other bytecode-level improvements.\n*   **Obfuscation:** It renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short, meaningless names (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`). This makes it much harder for others to reverse-engineer your app.\nIt is important for release builds because it helps to reduce the app size, improve runtime performance, and protect your intellectual property by making the code difficult to understand if decompiled.",

        questionText = "How can you optimize loading large bitmaps in Android to avoid `OutOfMemoryError`?",
        answerText = "1. **Load Scaled Bitmaps:** Read the bitmap dimensions first by setting `BitmapFactory.Options.inJustDecodeBounds = true`. Then, calculate an appropriate `BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize` to load a scaled-down version of the image into memory that matches the display dimensions, significantly reducing memory usage. After calculating `inSampleSize`, set `inJustDecodeBounds = false` and decode the bitmap. 2. **Use Image Loading Libraries:** Libraries like Glide, Coil, or Picasso are highly recommended. They automatically handle bitmap caching (memory and disk), downsampling, transformations, and efficient loading, abstracting away many complexities and reducing the risk of `OutOfMemoryError`. 3. **Recycle Bitmaps (Carefully):** For manually managed `Bitmap` objects, especially in older code or specific low-level scenarios, call `bitmap.recycle()` when it's no longer needed to free up native memory. However, this is error-prone and less necessary with modern Android versions and image loading libraries, which often manage this. 4. **Use Appropriate Bitmap Configuration:** Choose a `Bitmap.Config` that suits your needs. For example, `Bitmap.Config.RGB_565` uses 2 bytes per pixel instead of 4 bytes for `Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888`, which can halve memory usage if alpha transparency is not required. 5. **Handle Large Images in Background Threads:** Perform bitmap decoding and processing off the main UI thread (e.g., using coroutines or other threading mechanisms) to prevent ANRs.",

Key best practices include:\n\n1.  **Use HTTPS Everywhere:** Always use HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) instead of HTTP for all network communications. [2, 15] HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the app and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. [2]\n\n2.  **Use Network Security Configuration (NSC):** This is a declarative XML file where you can define network security policies for your app without changing app code. [5] Key features include:\n    *   **Disabling Cleartext Traffic:** You can prevent the app from accidentally using unencrypted (HTTP) traffic, which is the default for apps targeting Android 9 (API level 28) and higher. [4, 5]\n    *   **Certificate Pinning:** You can restrict your app's secure connections to particular certificates or public keys. [5, 7] This helps prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker might use a fraudulent certificate. [14] While powerful, it should be implemented carefully with backup pins and short expiration times to avoid connectivity issues if the server's certificate changes. [11]\n    *   **Custom Trust Anchors:** Define a custom set of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), for example, for a self-signed or internal company certificate. [3, 5]\n\n3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data Before Transmission:** For highly sensitive data, consider encrypting it on the client-side before sending it over HTTPS. [6] This provides an additional layer of protection. Use strong, modern encryption algorithms like AES-256. [9]\n\n4.  **Protect API Keys and Secrets:** Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or other secrets in your source code. [10] Use secure storage mechanisms like the Android Keystore to store them, or retrieve them from a secure server at runtime.\n\n5.  **Use Modern TLS Protocols:** Ensure your server and client support modern and secure versions of the TLS protocol (e.g., TLS 1.2 or 1.3) and strong cipher suites.

The best practice is a defense-in-depth approach that combines encrypted storage with secure key management.\n\n1.  **Avoid Storing Secrets Whenever Possible:** The most secure method is to not store sensitive data on the device at all. [17] Process it on a secure backend when feasible. [17]\n\n2.  **Use the Android Keystore System:** The Android Keystore is not a direct data storage solution, but a secure container for cryptographic keys. [4] Its primary role is to store encryption keys in a way that makes them difficult to extract from the device. [2] On modern devices, keys are protected within secure hardware (like a Trusted Execution Environment - TEE), meaning the key material itself is never exposed to the application or the OS. [3, 17] The Keystore performs cryptographic operations like encryption and decryption internally. [3, 4]\n\n3.  **Encrypt Data Using Keystore-Managed Keys:** The recommended approach is to generate a cryptographic key inside the Android Keystore and use it to encrypt sensitive data. [10, 17] The encrypted data can then be stored in a standard storage location like a file or database. [4]\n\n4.  **Leverage the Jetpack Security (Crypto) Library:** This library simplifies the process of securing data.

[17, 7] Key types include:\n\n1.  **Intent Interception/Hijacking:** Occurs when an app sends an implicit Intent (specifying an action but not a target component) containing sensitive data. [5, 17] A malicious app can register an Intent Filter for the same action to intercept this data. [5, 17]\n2.  **Intent Spoofing:** A malicious app sends a crafted Intent directly to one of your app's exported components to trigger an unintended action. [7]\n3.  **Intent Redirection:** An attacker tricks a privileged, exported component (like an Activity) into forwarding a malicious, embedded Intent to a private, non-exported component. [14] This allows the attacker to access components that are supposed to be internal to your app. [14, 7]\n\n**Best Practices for Mitigation:**\n\n*   **Prefer Explicit Intents:** For all internal app communication, always use explicit Intents, which specify the exact component (e.g., `MyActivity.class`) to handle the Intent. This prevents any other app from intercepting it. [7]\n*   **Minimize Exported Components:** In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, set `android:exported=\"false\"` for all components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers) that do not need to be accessible to other apps. This is the most effective way to prevent spoofing and redirection. [7]\n*   **Validate All Incoming Intent Data:** Never trust data received from an external Intent, even from an App Link/Deep Link. [7, 1] Always validate and sanitize any parameters, URIs, or extras before using them to prevent issues like path traversal or injection attacks. [2, 1]\n*   **Use `setPackage()` for Implicit Intents:** If you must use an implicit Intent to interact with another app, specify the target app's package name using `intent.setPackage(\"com.example.targetapp\")` to ensure only that app can receive it. [5]\n*   **Secure Deep Links:** For deep links, use App Links with `android:autoVerify=\"true\"`. This verifies that your app is the official handler for your domain, preventing malicious apps from intercepting these links.

[17] They are small, focused tests that verify individual units of code (like a single function or class) in isolation. [5, 8] They run on a local JVM without needing an Android device or emulator, which makes them extremely fast. [5, 14] Dependencies are often replaced with 'test doubles' (like mocks or fakes) to isolate the code under test. [1]\n\n2.  **Integration Tests (20%):** This middle layer tests how multiple components work together. [12, 17] This could involve testing the interaction between a ViewModel and a Repository, or a Repository and a database. These tests can be either local unit tests or instrumented tests, depending on whether they need Android framework components.\n\n3.  **UI/End-to-End Tests (10%):** At the top of the pyramid are large tests that validate complete user flows.

It is pre-programmed with expectations about which of its methods will be called, with what arguments, and in what order. After the test runs, the mock is verified to ensure those expected interactions occurred. Mocks are useful when you need to confirm that your code under test correctly communicates with its dependencies (e.g., \"Did the presenter call `view.showError()` when the data fetch failed?\").\n\n*   **Fake:** A fake is a test double that provides a lightweight, working implementation of the dependency. It doesn't have pre-programmed expectations like a mock, but it simulates the real object's behavior in a simplified way. A common example is an in-memory database that replaces a real database, or a fake repository that returns hardcoded data instead of making a network call. Fakes are useful for **state verification**, where you care about the outcome or state change after an action (e.g., \"Does the ViewModel's state correctly reflect the user data returned by the fake repository?\").\n\nIn short: Use **Mocks** to verify interactions.

If you add a JavaScript interface (`addJavascriptInterface`) to a WebView, malicious JavaScript from a compromised or untrusted website could potentially call public methods of that Java/Kotlin object, leading to the execution of unintended native code. [1]\n\n**Best Practices for Mitigation:**\n\n1.  **Disable JavaScript If Not Needed:** The safest approach is to not enable JavaScript if the WebView is only used to display simple web content without interactivity. Disable it via `WebSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`. [1]\n\n2.  **Limit Content Loading:** Only load content from trusted, whitelisted domains. Avoid loading arbitrary URLs from Intents or other uncontrolled sources. You can override `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` in your `WebViewClient` to control which URLs are loaded. [3]\n\n3.  **Secure JavaScript Interfaces:** If you must use a JavaScript interface:\n    *   **Use `@JavascriptInterface`:** For apps targeting Android 4.2 (API 17) and higher, only methods explicitly annotated with `@JavascriptInterface` are exposed to JavaScript. [1] Always use this annotation and expose as few methods as possible.

[5]\n\n**Dalvik (Legacy Runtime, up to Android 4.4):**\n*   **Compilation Strategy:** Used a **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler. [2, 13] This means that each time you ran an app, Dalvik would dynamically translate a portion of the app's bytecode into native machine code on the fly. [15, 13]\n*   **Performance:** App startup was generally faster, but overall performance could be less consistent because compilation was happening during execution. This consumed CPU cycles and battery power every time the app was used. [7, 15]\n*   **Installation & Storage:** App installation was quick and took up less space initially, as the code was not pre-compiled. [7, 13]\n\n**ART (Android Runtime, Android 5.0 and later):**\n*   **Initial Strategy (AOT):** ART was introduced with an **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** compilation strategy. [2, 7] This meant that the entire application was compiled into native machine code *at the time of installation*. [15]\n*   **Modern Strategy (Hybrid AOT + JIT):** Starting with Android 7.0, ART evolved into a hybrid runtime. [1] It now uses a combination of AOT, JIT, and interpretation. [12] It uses **profile-guided compilation**, where it JIT-compiles frequently used code paths (\"hot\" code) as the app runs. [4] Then, when the device is idle and charging, ART AOT-compiles these hot parts for optimal performance on subsequent launches. [1, 12]\n\n**Key Benefits of ART over Dalvik:**\n*   **Faster App Execution:** Since code is pre-compiled (either fully AOT or via profile-guided AOT), apps generally run faster and smoother, without the runtime overhead of JIT compilation for frequently used code. [1, 7]\n*   **Improved Battery Life:** By compiling code once during installation or idle periods, ART reduces the CPU load during regular app usage, leading to better battery performance. [3, 7]\n*   **Optimized Garbage Collection:** ART features a more advanced and efficient garbage collector, resulting in fewer and shorter pauses during app execution. [3, 6]",

However, the asynchronous operation would continue running, wasting device resources and potentially leading to memory leaks or crashes if it tried to update a non-existent UI. [3, 8] Developers had to write boilerplate code to cancel these jobs in the `ViewModel`'s `onCleared()` method. [9]\n\n**How `viewModelScope` Solves It:**\n\n`viewModelScope` provides a structured concurrency solution by automatically linking coroutines to the `ViewModel`'s lifecycle. [3, 5] Any coroutine launched within `viewModelScope` is automatically canceled when the `ViewModel` is cleared (i.e., when its `onCleared()` method is called). [1, 2] This completely eliminates the need for manual cancellation and prevents resource leaks, making the code cleaner and safer. [3, 11]\n\n**In summary:** `viewModelScope` simplifies asynchronous programming in `ViewModels` by providing a scope that automatically handles the cancellation of coroutines when they are no longer needed, ensuring that long-running operations don't outlive the `ViewModel`.

        answerText = "While often set to the same value, `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` serve distinct and critical roles in Android development. [6]\n\n**`compileSdk` (Compile SDK Version):**\n*   **What it is:** This property tells Gradle which version of the Android SDK to use when compiling your application. [2, 6] It defines the set of APIs that your code can access during development. [1, 5]\n*   **Effect:** Setting `compileSdk` to a new version (e.g., 34) allows you to use APIs introduced in that version. [5] If you try to use a new API without updating the `compileSdk`, you will get a compilation error. [1, 5] Changing `compileSdk` by itself does not change the runtime behavior of your app. [1, 6]\n*   **Analogy:** Think of it as the version of the \"toolbox\" or \"library\" you are coding against. [2]\n\n**`targetSdk` (Target SDK Version):**\n*   **What it is:** This property is a signal to the Android operating system about which API level your app was designed and tested for. [1, 6] It's your promise that the app behaves correctly on that Android version. [2]\n*   **Effect:** The Android OS uses this value to enable or disable forward-compatibility behaviors. [1] When you update the `targetSdk`, your app opts into all the new runtime behaviors, security restrictions, and performance optimizations of that API level. For example, if your app targets a lower API level than the device's OS, the system might apply backward-compatibility behaviors to ensure your app doesn't break. [6]\n*   **Analogy:** Think of it as the \"compatibility promise\" you make to the Android OS. [2]\n\n**In Summary:**\n*   `compileSdk` is a build-time instruction that gives you access to new APIs. [9]\n*   `targetSdk` is a runtime instruction that tells the OS how to run your app, enabling modern platform features and restrictions. [9]\n\nBest practice is to keep `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` at the latest stable API level after thoroughly testing your app to ensure it handles all the new runtime changes correctly. [2, 1]",
